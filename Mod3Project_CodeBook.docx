NOTES
1.	Ideally the variable names must be in lower case but to make it more readable, I have kept first letter in upper case for different words in same variable name
2.	Prefix “t” in some variables’ names represents time domain signals
3.	Prefix “f” in some variables’ names represents frequency domain signals
4.	I have considered angular data as well because these measurements include one of the mean measurements and as per instructions, we had to extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
